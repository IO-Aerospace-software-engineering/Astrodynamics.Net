IO.SDK.Net is the .Net connector to [IO.SDK native library](https://github.com/IO-Aerospace-software-engineering/SDK).

It allows .Net developers to call high level features :

* Load [JPL Spice kernels](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data.html)
* Run propagator to evaluate maneuvers and fuel consumption
* Evaluate launch opportunities
* Convert elapsed seconds from J2000 to TDB or UTC string
* Find time windows based on distance constraints
* Find time windows based on occultation constraints
* Find time windows based on coordinate constraints
* Find time windows based on illumination constraints
* Find time windows when an object is in instrument field of view.
